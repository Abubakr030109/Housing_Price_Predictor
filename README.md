# Housing Price Predictor

This is a Machine Learning model trained to predict the **price** of a house, based on:
- **Number of bedrooms**: the number of bedrooms in the housing unit.
- **Net Square Meters:** total usable interior space within the housing unit. It quantifies the size of the property.
- **Center Distance:** the distance of the housing unit from the central or downtown area of a city or town.
- **Metro Distance:** the distance between the housing unit and the nearest metro or subway station.
- **Floor:** the level or story of the housing unit within the building.
- **Age:** the number of years since its construction or renovation.

I've trained the model on 3 different algorithms to see which algorithm peforms the best. Namely:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

In the end, Linear Regression seems to be the best out of the above 3 tested.

There is still room for further optimization and experimentation. But, based on the metrics provided, the model already seems to be very accurate.
